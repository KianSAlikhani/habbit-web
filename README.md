# Habbit

Habbit is an intuitive application that helps you set and achieve goals that you've been putting off for way too long. Whether it's taking a walk, eating healty, reading a book, or just want to start something new, Habbit will help you by setting small incremental objectives that you can work towards.

Habbit is currently very early in development, and is not currently available to use. If you would like to track the progress of its development, watch or star this repository as regular updates will be made.
